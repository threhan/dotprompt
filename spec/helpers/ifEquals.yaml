# Tests for the {{#ifEquals}} helper which performs strict equality comparison
# between two values and conditionally renders content based on the result.
#
# Note: This helper uses strict equality (===) rather than loose equality (==)
# to ensure consistent behavior across different language runtimes (JavaScript,
# Go, Python). This means that values of different types are always considered
# unequal, even if they could be coerced to the same value (e.g., 5 !== "5").

# Tests basic equality comparison with same-type values, verifying that
# the appropriate branch is rendered based on strict equality.
